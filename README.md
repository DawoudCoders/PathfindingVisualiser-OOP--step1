# PathfindingVisualiser-basic-

This is my first step towards making a visual and interactive pathfinding algortihim wesbite, where you can choose from multiple different algorithims. 

To use:
- Fork & clone down the repo
- Install liveserver (vscode) 
- Drag/drop the start and end node as desired
- click on any node to make it a wall 
- Red line shows the shortest path

In this repo I:
- Utilised OOP in a project for the first time
- Built a grid of nodes that could be dragged/dropped & have blockable features
- Tapped into an opensource version of the A* pathfinding algorithim to find the shortest path
- Used SVG/Path to visualise this path

Although I have an understanding of how the A* algorithim works, at this stage it was too complex for me to build. In the next repo I plan to build my own breadth first search and use that implementation.
